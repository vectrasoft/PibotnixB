You need pi-blaster installed and working for this script to work.

Video streaming with a PS Eye webcam came from this thread:
http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=19661

The exact steps I took with Model B 512MB RAM and PS Eye are as follows:
wget http://www.bobtech.ro/get?download=36:mjpg-streamer-rpi
mv get\?download\=36\:mjpg-streamer-rpi mjpg-streamer-rpi.tar.gz
tar -zxvf mjpg-streamer-rpi.tar.gz
cd mjpg-streamer
sudo nano mjpg-streamer.sh
Change YUV="false" to YUV="true"
Change Resolution to 320x240
I did not change the Port setting, but you can if needed.
